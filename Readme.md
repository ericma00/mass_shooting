The purpose of this project is to learn how to use Leaflet.js, a JavaScript mapping library. 

The project takes in a data of mass shootings that occured in 2016 (in csv file) and uses the Leaflet.js library to map the data points of each of the respective locations.

There are 2 types of data, injured and killed. The type of data point is represented by a specific color, as explained in the demo.
